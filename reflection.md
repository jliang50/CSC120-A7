- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    A class can inherit the methods of a parent class.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This assignment was completed smoothly. All methods worked.
    I became more comfortable using common ArrayList methods like add(), remove(), and contains(), and learned how to leverage these tools to perform real-world operations, such as checking for duplicates before adding a resident or ensuring safe removal.
